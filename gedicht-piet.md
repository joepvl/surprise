Hey yo this is Piet,

Yeah that's exactly how we do;
Enter the mind of a guy
Who spends his days with a roe

And I don't mean caviar or a kangaroo, my dear
I mean the Dutch type you hit kids with
When they've been bad for a year

Basically, a torture device made out of twigs
Let me reiterate this set of facts
A sharp wooden tool for hitting kids
Now who the heck came up with that?!

This guy right here, with his big ol' staff
That's the real nature of the Sint,
And he does it for a laugh

Well this is where it ends, Sint
This is as far as it goes
You'll wish you were in Motueka
When you get washed away by my flows

The other side of the planet
That's where I'll send you tonight
It's morning there, no need to plan it
Already booked you a flight

It starts right here and right now
On the tip of my shoe
I'm gonna kick you with a curve so sharp,
You'll make a stopover in Timbuktu

So quit yer lyin' Sint,
When you're flyin', Sint,
And the low atmospheric pressure makes you feel like you're dyin', Sint,
Might as well stop tryin' friend,
'Cause we all die in the end
So why not start now, and save us all the cryin' pretence

End of story for you
And Femke is mine
I'll take her ass to yoga class,
Slow-juice her, one-of-a-kind
Sorry 'bout that rhyme
I just had to combine
Those two words in my mind
And they came out, like the tide
